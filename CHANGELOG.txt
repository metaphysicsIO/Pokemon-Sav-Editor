* Created the changelog file, knowing that I should have been using git.
* Added checksum subroutine
* Add text-table conversion
* I changed vector "offset" to "mem". It made no sense to call it "offset" when
  it was the set that is mem contains offsets.
* Tested modMem subroutine (changed the first char in OT name to "Z".): It
  worked.
* Tested the save feature. It works.
* Finally got the money edit to work.
* Probably going to push this up in a few moments.
