# Pokemon Sav Editor (PSE)
## Mionathraìm SAV

This is a command-line, GNU/Linux supported Pokemon SAV editor.

It currently only supports Pokemon Red and Blue.

I was going to go with my normal naming theme, but thought "Mionathraìm SAV"
might be too hard to type/pronounce. So, it'll be "Pokemon Sav Editor (PSE)"
and in the sub-title we'll call it "Mionathraìm SAV".

## Why a pokemon sav editor?

PKHeX doesn't work on Linux. This does.

## Release

I did compile it using `g++ (Gentoo 12.2.1_p20230304 p13) 12.2.1 20230304`
so if that will work fine for you, go for it.


## What about other generations?

This is just a starting point. Feel free to help though.


## What about [thing you want]

Request it, give me the offset addr, or add it in yourself. This is just
something I'm doing. 


## What actually works?



You can change your name, your rival's name, your pokedollars, and your
party's species and stats. 

I technically have the item editing working, but you'd have to edit
the code to access that. I will probably implement that soon enough.

## Plans

* Item editing

* View, Edit pokemon in each box.


## How to run

```
$ sh compile.sh
$ ./SE.o [FILENAME].sav

```

## Contribute

Make a PR.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to basically create a PKHeX replacement for Linux.
I want to go all the way up to modern generations, if possible.


## Nice idea

Language support for: ie_gle, ja_jp
