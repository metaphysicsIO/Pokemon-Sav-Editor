Stuff to keep in mind.

# Random note
##

I have found three offset points require an ending with 0x50:
0x259E, 0x25FD, 2C5E

0x259E is the trainer, 0x25FD is the rival, but I am uncertain what 2C5E is at
this time.


##
# Specific offset points
##

# TRAINER NAME:
OFFSET: 0x2598 - 0x259E
NOTE: It must end with 0x50

# RIVAL NAME:
OFFSET: 0x25F6 - 0x25FD
NOTE: It must end with 0x50

# MONEY:
OFFSET: 0x25F3 - 0x25F5
NOTE: Reads hex weird. Only accepts 0-9. Basically, do not convert with money.
